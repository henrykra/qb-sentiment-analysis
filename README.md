# qb-sentiment-analysis


3 quarterbacks were selected with the top three picks in the 2024 NFL draft. Quarterback is the most idolized and scrutinzed position in football, and with the top-selecetions of the draft belonging to poorly performing franchises, fans are bound to have strong opinions over their team's new signalcaller. This project uses comments data from the Youtupe API on 9 separate youtube videos about each of the top 3 quarterbacks. 3 videos are from the teams' official channels, 3 from ESPN, and three from a film breakdown video. A larger and more representative sample of reactions are likely necessary for more robust analysis, but the notebook provides some unique insight into how fans are feeling about their new quarterback, on average, and how different media sources inspire different reactions.
