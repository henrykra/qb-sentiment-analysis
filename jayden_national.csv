"Don’t matter who is under center for the Porkskins, they will be petrified of Jalen Carter",
"Watch Minnesota draft Daniels",
"This is one of the reasons bringing them in together is beneficial..to be mad about this shows a bit of your true character..this is a bad reaction to the situation..its exactly the type of info the team is tryng to get",
"I take pre-draft discussions with a grain of salt.  All kinds of planted info leading up to the actual draft.",
"This has the CJ Stroud vibes from last year",
"I hope Washington doesn't draft him. It's obviously a no no after agents reaction and his player.  Can't handle stress. Multiple Trade to get more players to fill in holes.",
"Adam Schefter always sounds like he's running out of breath.",
"Top Golf sucks....pay 125 bucks to go to a driving range? Hell no.",
"Oh so he's a sensitive little bia and scared of competition besides being a wee man RG IV type......",
"BFD!!!!",
"Daniels needs to stay humble. Prove your worth when you're on the field.",
"Schefter and kiper are idiots. Can't believe they get paid for their stupid opinions",
"How many times has this happened before for starting QB positions? This seems really abnormal and if it wasnt relayed to the player or his agent that the meet would be with the other candidates, then hell yea he should be pissed. Who goes to a job interview where right before you attend the company meet says hey we are going to make this a 4 way interview with your competition present??",
"That stutter sound bite at 7:27 is crazy 😂😂",
"I would not want to play for Washington commanders at all. I would pull a straight Eli manning",
"The Commies are still a thing? Worst Team name ever.",
"😂 Washington should tell agent to dry his tears with his commission check...These Prima Donna athletes need to be reminded the honor and privilege it is the be a high paid worker in the NFL ownership is flipping the narrative or script on them good....😊😊",
"Well don't DRAFT HIM!!!!!!!😊",
"That’s like going into a job interview when you know there’s other applicants for the same job and being pissed off that there are other applicants sitting in the lobby waiting for their interview along with you. 😂😂😂",
"Go to the Raiders Jayden.",
"Daniel's  camp has already cleared the air! Nothing to worry about, just typical  media and source reports trying to make something out of nothing! Smdh.  Watch Rio Robinson post and you hear the truth!",
"Washington FU",
"Both my teams are two of the most dysfunctional in the league. Commanders and Jags.... Disgusting. Its exhausting being fans of those organizations. I'm now a Baltimore fan from here on out. 😂",
"Schefter saying lets be honest is a complete joke. The guys a clown",
"How stupid are people. The agent isn’t a super agent. Danial’s is not a Manning either. Try to play that game and ruin your career. Be thankful you’re going to the  league. Ego!!!",
"Shefter is a rat",
"Jayden Daniels and his agent  massively screwed up. If I were Washington I would have nothing more to do with that duo. I would have done the same thing if I were Washington. It was a test. J.D. messed the bed. What a child. Instead of charging into the challenge and proving he's the man he whimpered like a little child. Jayden Daniels has BUST written all over him. He  got intimidated, felt threatened and disrespected and went crying to his mommy agent. What a joke.",
"His agent could have spun it as positive for Jayden by telling to purposely be horrible at Top Golf, and then save himself by emphasizing that he spends his free time working on his QB play rather than a golf swing.",
"He will be broken in half and be a huge bust. You know, like RG 3 and countless other dual threat guys",
"Redskins!  Run the ball.",
"The QB pick that paints his fingernails, and who knows what else other fem behaviors, is a drama queen in the waiting.   Not good for the locker room.  Imagine he shows up to locker room  and changes into some pink panties, too.   Can't see how anybody would want that drama.",
"After watching Quinn basically quit coaching his Defense with the Cowboys, I don’t know how anyone can think DQ is a great leader.  I thought he was until his last year in Texas. And WTF is the footnote at the bottom of the page?  ESPN is run by a bunch of ball-less maroons.",
"Good way to weed out the divas! Leave the string-bean running man alone! It's DM or JJ for me since day 1!",
"What are these creative fellas gonna slip into Belichik’s draft special drink to make him appear even semi-human for a little while?",
"I mean it's been a moderately cringy offseason for the Commanders.  Shouldn't the Commanders have who they want at #2 for their QB?  It's not like the QBs all have the same style.",
"JD showing he a DIVA. Dont want him.",
"H,,,. teams where rookie QBs go to have short painful careers. I'll start. Bears, Skins, Browns.",
"He wants to be a Patriot",
"Always the same type of mental QB's that complain or whine...and they never do well",
"A group interview!? Is this an interview for zumies or chipotle?",
"It's not surprising its Washington they suck at everything",
"Why bring in all QB's on the same day, but do your visit and go home Jayden",
"Jayden doing everything they said Caleb was supposedly doing and being called a diva for it.",
"So? Drake Maye, and none of the other QBs cared about it. It just makes him look like a diva.  He’s still going to the commanders if they want him.",
"Naw its wedge, iron, and driver",
"Change the name, change the logo and they still can’t help but to be the Dead Skins 🤣🤣🤣",
"Daniels should run from Washington. Dysfunctional franchise that kills talent @ QB. The aim is to get the second contract not the highest rookie contract. That means stability. Something that Washington will never offer.",
"Smells like a snowflake or Ryan Leaf to me. 1- ur in your feelings because you didn’t get ur 1 on 1 yet, weak minded. Yeah you might suck at top golf what was important is how you interact with others in a fun competitive environment. 2- Snowflakes are not going to make it in DC, glad to pick someone else and avoid a mal content employee that’s not even in the building yet. Hard pass, dude’s already causing drama instead of being humble. Number 2 overall is not a right",
"No way they should have had him come in alone show him the franchise start off on the right foot with all those top quarterbacks and whoever the first picks gonna be deserves that, not a cattle call",
"The field is trash. The facility is trash. The taxes are going to eat up 20% of his contract. When's the last time Washington had a stable qb?  37 years ago.   Just contract the league or move the franchise.",
"Raiders take that #3 pick from N.E & maybe Jayden Daniels let's Commanders know ayye I wanna play with my guy Antonio Pierce just go ahead and swap picks already 💯💪 ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️ wishful thought haha",
"Raiders take that #3 pick from N.E & maybe Jayden Daniels let's Commanders know ayye I wanna play with my guy Antonio Pierce just go ahead and swap picks already 💯💪 ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️ wishful thought haha",
"Where’s Rapsheet?",
"Maybe he doesn't want to go to Washington",
"I like how he thinks he has a choice . But I wouldn't draft someone that doesn't want to be there",
"That’s how he makes his choice. Show the team you don’t wanna be there. Washington would be dumb to draft a QB at 2 that doesn’t wanna be there.",
"Is this Draft a repeat of Manning, Rivers and Roethlisberger ? Only time will tell. I'm not high on Daniels. His slight of build is not much talked about. I think Penix could be a steal in this Draft going forward.",
"Washington is where QB careers end. Chicago too. I wouldn’t want to be drafted by either team if I wanted a career and to win.",
