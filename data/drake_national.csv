"@@king_supreme1102 he’s not even that. Russ was a WAAAAAY better QB than Lamar is today. Lamar won’t be as good as Russ is today at 35 years old. Russ was a prolific pocket QB that could create openings with his legs. That’s more like Caleb. Jayden is a poor man’s Justin fields be ma use he can’t throw over the middle. People need to start comparing these QBs to active players to see how they will stack up instead of with each other. I do t like Jayden and I don’t like Maye. Jj McCarthy and Penix are behind Caleb but I honestly think JJ might be better. If the body of work was bigger there would be no question",

And we have that information on other QBs in this draft, so it's just working with what you have to work with really.",
"If Drake goes to the Patriots... he is playing with much better players. NC was a team deviod of talent",

"@@Johnbones23 Don't see mention of JJ by anyone in here...",
"@@RyTrapp0 I know wasnt saying that’s what u said just heard the most noise from media for JJ being the other option at 3 instead of Drake",

"A guy once was lost in the middle of the woods. The game commission could not find him after multiple attempts. So they enlisted Drake Mayes’ help. Maye stood at the tree line, tied a transmitter to a football, and threw      the football 2 miles directly into the lost man’s cold dead hands. Unfortunately they were too late.",
"I just don't see a world where they don't go: Williams 1, Maye 2, Daniels 3.",
"Absolutely possible JJ is drafted above Maye or Daniels.",
"@@zgoblueover maye maybe but Daniels doesn’t fall farther than 3",
"3 could be changed out possible, but I agree , I think top two are definitely set. Drama however creates storylines and controversies... I could see Daniels or JJ going third,  depending how the draft goes..",
"Because the best player in the draft is Marvin Harrison Jr",
"Why so confident in Williams? What exactly has he done?",
"May is an interception machine waiting to happen. He may become good. But he has a lot of work to be done before he’s good enough to be a really good qb.",
"So who do the Patriots grab Drake Maye l, JJ McCarthy or Jayden Daniels",
"Drake Maye will be a great Patriots!  Unbiased opinion from a Patriots fan 😊",
"I got so confused when I saw Pendrick Kerickins in here",
"I would take Drake over the two the experts put on the pedestal",
"Biggest knock on Maye is consistency. Only thing he did EVERY game, was be inconsistent. He has great measurables, sure. But, for every great throw, good read, or NFL-caliber play; there's a missed throw, terrible decision, bad footwork, or a moment of questionable pocket awareness.  He'll leave the pocket too early. He'll get happy feet and appear nervous - instead of trusting the playcall and read. His line was terrible and his receivers averaged a couple of drops per game, which is an explanation. However, he also would get picked off on some easy reads. He threw several pick-6's that were easily avoidable, and that is something that will only get worse in The League.  Question is: can it be coached out of him? Or is this part of his DNA, being a gifted athlete who just can't consistently make the right decision.",
"Part of this can also be due to a bad system and surrounding talent. Remember, Justin Herbert wasn't very efficient and he threw more bubble screens than anyone else in college. We thought Herbert was a project guy, and he came in and was amazing instantly. That's why it's so hard to project these guys. Cause a dude who was inconsistent in college can be a paragon of consistent efficiency in the pros, and guys who are considered high floor, safe picks wind up stinking. For example, Mac Jones. He was supposed to be a layup. And the guy has all sorts of attitude issues, he makes horrible decisions, his lack of mobility is punishing, and he doesn't have the processing ability that everyone thought would be a guarantee. QB scouting is maybe the most difficult evaluation in all of sports. Cause you can have none of the physical traits and be Tom Brady, Brock Purdy, just a guy who finds a way. Or you can have all the tools in the world and be Justin fields, you can be Malik Willis, hell, you can be jameis Winston!",
"Thank you finally someone who has actually watched him play",
"@@greyklopstock7155 totally agree with you. I just wrote about what I saw on film. But, system and coaching can make, or break, a player.",
"A good coach with a good scheme can break those habits.",
"I see what you’re saying. He’s still pretty young and seems to be pretty coachable, so I think those are things he could definitely be fixed with the right coaching and work. I think if he’s given the amount of patience Josh Allen was given he could turn out pretty great, but it seems like teams are getting less and less patient with qb development these days.",

There is always one... and so, (Dramatic music)  It begins.... again. There is a new disturbance in the force. I can sense a fear growing in Buffalo as their hope to become a legitimate faction in thee senate fades as  what they dread most seems to returning. The rise of Drake. A Superbowl saga.  Found in the outer regions a young man whom the force has seemed to have chosen to re-awaken the spirit of those who dwell in all of New England planets. There is rumor SB Master himself may offer some guidance to the youngling. We very well may be looking at the beginning of something even one day the Chiefs may dread.  Time... will.. tell. For now, MAYE the Force be with us.",
"@@Ta_Fortis.The_BraveI’ve been stating my claim that Drake Maye is jim Kelly 2.0 😂😂 both big arm QBs. Both the 3 QB drafted in a draft class that had 6 QBs go in the first round. Both grew up with multiple brothers and both state how that made them tough. Haha. I’m troll but part of me wants to believe it 😂. Hopefully that comes to fruition",
"@@Ta_Fortis.The_Brave Lol. I think just about everyone is sick of the Patriots being in the Super Bowl every other year. Now it's the Chiefs turn to run the league until Mahomes starts to decline.",
"The best qb will be Daniel’s, Williams, and penix",
"🧢",
"May is an interception machine waiting to happen. He may become good. But he has a lot of work to be done before he’s good enough to be a really good qb.",
"Caleb Williams ' grit worries me the most, and im a Bears Fan. nails and tears and NIL money and Hollywood time worries me",
"Drake Maye = Brett Favre",
"“Maxx Crosby is THE 2024 DPOY” - Former NFL Guru",
"Maye's character is the complete opposite of Williams. It will be interesting to see these two in the NFL.",
"Lies",
"Pat stop with this comparison. Dudes gonna flop. Luck was 1 of 1. Imagine if the colts actually supported him during his career. He’d have a ring or two for sure.",
"He’s trying to sell him to the Vikings lol",
"Drake Maye will be a great Patriots!  Unbiased opinion from a Patriots fan 😊",
"As a UNC fan/ alum I will immediately become a fan of where Maye goes. He easily loyal to a family legacy. His dad was a qb at UNC. Loyalty.",
"So retire early because of all kinds of issues? Great projection",
"I got so confused when I saw Pendrick Kerickins in here",
"As somene from the UK, it actually cracks me up how much the USA sports media hypes prospects. Just doesn't happen to the same degree over here",
"Drake Maye's throwing motion screams 5+ strip sacks a season, plus it looks slow as molasses compared to Calib, Jayden, and JJ",
"Drake May is Mitchel Trubisky 2.0.",
"Maye is a bust",
"From someone who's from NC born and raised have watched drake maye closely for awhile now!! He could of went to Alabama, but stayed loyal to his family and went to UNC, get this guy a good o-line and some Weapons he's gonna be legit!! He's NFL ready, to the team that takes him 👏 congrats you will have your future QB",
"Every year they overlook a quarterback this year's the same I think the South Carolina quarterback it's going to be better than all of them",
"Most likely the order goes 1. Williams 2. Maye 3. Daniels. I think the McCarthy hype is just fabricated (see Will Levis). Williams probably proves less impressive than advertised, Maye becomes a fanchise QB, Daniels either slides in as a lower franchise QB or becomea a very good journeyman",
"Drake Maye couldn’t even win the ACC",
"Man... Andrew Luck took a 2-14 team the year before to 11-5 and playoff birth his rookie year.  Maye isnt even close to Luck.  They arent even on the same planet or in the same dimensionm.  Just stop all with all the nonsense.",
"🤣🤣🤣🤣 right",
"A guy once was lost in the middle of the woods. The game commission could not find him after multiple attempts. So they enlisted Drake Mayes’ help. Maye stood at the tree line, tied a transmitter to a football, and threw      the football 2 miles directly into the lost man’s cold dead hands. Unfortunately they were too late.",
"Lmaoooo bro Andrew Luck was LIGHTYEARS ahead of Drake Maye this is crazy. Luck was consensus number 1 pick 2 years before he was drafted. I hate this time of year man so many trash “hot takes”",
"If Caleb Williams wasn't coming out,, this would be true about Maye also.. Sometimes it's about who your coming out with.. in terms of draft stock",
"the media is insane. its like theyre deliberately trying to destroy franchises pushing these overly raw quarterbacks on what they COULD be vs. what they actually are.",
"Caleb is light years ahead of the other QB prospect’s, 🐻🔽",
"And people really here saying Maye so much better and him and jj are fakes… lol",
"He’s going to the Commanders.",
"As a bears fan I’m rioting if we don’t draft Caleb we traded fields for nothing if they decide to draft a different qb number 1 news cycle is slow they got nothing to talk about besides Vikings possibly trading up and if JD or Maye should be picked number 1",
"Every year they say this .",
"Perkins king of white hate. 😂",
"There will be 1 great or good QB from the top of this draft over the next 10 years. All hype like always.",
"Indy people really love to tell everyone how great Luck was, but in reality he really was mediocre. Also the idea that a football player going to Stanford means they're smart is comical. You really think these schools hold them to any standard of academic success? They push them through some liberal arts program with answer keys and endless cheating so they can play football. Anyone that's been at a big college has seen this.",
"Vikings will get him.",
"And then you woke up.",
"If we’re basing this off of if their team can win Caleb Williams had a much better team and also lost a lot of games",
"College QBs are absolute trash. All of them. It doesnt matter if they are the best in college or the worst, they are essentially equally trash when compared to the NFL. In order to be good in the NFL in todays era ( they dont develop QBs) you need a veteran QB to help teach them, you need a great QB room, great QB coach, you need them to be consistent, and you need a competent team put them on. Look at any good QB, mahomes had a great team and had alex Smith, CJ Stroud is not a magical once in a life time situation, he is what happens when you do it right and have all the components you need when taking a rookie Qb. CJ Stroud had a case Keenum and a great team and all the ither supportive things i mentioned. aaron rodgers had farve, love and rodgers, Purdy got to sit and learn and develop in an already good team, Dak sat behind Romo, josh allen went to a team that was already good. All these trash teams like the jets, giants, panthers, bears, etc. It doesnt matter if they get the next comming of tom brady. They will ruin their career because they dont have all the key components you need to develop a QB.",
"Hahahahaha 😂😂😂😂",
"Final College Season:  Trubisky: 6'2 222lb, 3748 yds, 68%, 30TDs, 6 INTs, 8-5 record  Maye: 6'5 220lb, 3608 yds, 63.3%, 24 TDs, 9 INTs, 8-5 record  Luck: 6'4 235lb, 3517 yds, 71.3%, 37 TDs, 10 INTS, 11-2 record   Comparing Maye to Luck is absolutely ridiculous. He's a taller and less accurate Trubisky. Bust written all over this dude.",
"I am not buying it ; he looks like frat guy that spin in it college but not NFL.",
"People forget too quick. Justin Herbert had the best rookie season in the NFL.",
"CJ stroud did buddy",
"Big Perk came out of nowhere lmao",
"🤣🤣🤣🤣",
"Any of the top 5 QB are pretty talented and could be successful. Some dude in the sixth round will probably out perform all of them 😂",
"Didn't like his swinging arm release",
"Realistically Andrew Luck won nothing and retired in the middle of a pre season game…..so is this suppose to be a positive comp?",
"He was a arguably top 5 qb in 2018. 39 tds 15ints 4500 yards. That’s a pretty good comparison. What does luck winning a championship do with his talent? Play style ?",
"He's Mitch 2.0",
"I wonder is Drake Maye will have the same Twitter game that Andrew Luck has",
"Listening to Perk talk about football is like that one friend that hops on a new trend and regurgitates all the talking points that everyone knows and plays it off like it was their own conclusion.",
"DRAKE MAYE IS 2-7 IN LAST 9 GAMES  CALEB WILLIAMS IS 1-4 LAST 5 GAMES  jAYDEN DANIELS SHOULD GO #1",
"I'd go with....the opposite of whatever Perkins says...",
"Mayes stats where not thatgreat not seeing what ype is about",
"I don't remember any past, elite, top QBs, ever regressing in college like Drake Maye did. If you aren't getting better in college how will you get better in the NFL?  Does this concern anyone?",
"Drake Maye didn't digress , the team did around him.",
"Marino due to similar circumstances.",
