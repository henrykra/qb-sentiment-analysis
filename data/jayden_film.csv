"The one thing about Daniels is I know people say he's a one year wonder and there is some truth to that but context is important. He had a good freshman season at ASU, I'm an ASU fan so watched every game, but his sophomore year was 2020, Covid year. That year was basically a lost year for development as they had mostly freshmen wide receivers, they played USC in the opening game, then went almost a month before playing again and they only played 4 games total. We saw some initial signs of trouble in 2020 that we just chalked up to Covid but 2021 was revealing as that was one of the worst coaching jobs we've ever seen at ASU. Go look at that 2021 ASU roster, guys like Pearsall, Johnny Wilson, several guys getting drafted plus a few more NFL guys were on that roster. ASU arguably had the most talented roster every game they played in that season and they struggled all year. Don't let the record or final scores of some of those games fool you, they struggled to beat bad teams, only beat one good team, lost to other good teams, heavily penalized, no discipline, had recruiting violations hanging over their head, it was a miserable season in which most of us wanted Edwards fired because we knew the final record of that team was a mirage.  Jayden goes to LSU and improves dramatically with some stability and good coaching. He still has some of the same issues he had at ASU but he also improved a lot both years so while he seems like a one year wonder, he also spent his first three years under a poor coaching staff.",
"There was another one year wonder at LSU. Look at how that turned out.",
"@@theacgkidFr. Ppl treat Jayden daniels like the perfect prospect cuz he went to lsu and won the Heisman which is respected by most football fans. You can find ppl calling out cons of other qb prospects like Caleb, drake, penix, nix, and jj but nobody comments anything bad abt Jayden. Like I can name 5 things that will not work out for Jayden in the league. Main problem for me about him is he just runs into defenders and his body size wouldn‚Äôt allow him to take those hits in the nfl.",
"So he‚Äôs a 2 year wonder",
"@@Cowgirls9ershaterNaw he definitely gets criticized. I say if you just watch ESPN probably not, but other places like PFF, Bleacher Report, Ringer, the Athletic are much lower on him. They all prefer Maye by wide margin. My issue is they do the same thing. They see Maye as best prospect since Trevor outside Caleb and some have him ahead of Caleb. You rarely hear any of his issues as prospect. Only when you watch ex QBs and ex coaches you hear his issues. He misses far too many easy throws and slides into pressure in pocket, making a bad line worse.   Coaches and ex players are just higher on Jayden because he ready to play tomorrow. I really only his size, and his arm isn‚Äôt elite, but ok. I rather average arm that make all the throws and accurate consistently.",
"@@terencebarnes7393 Not high on drake maye either tbh. But yeah I‚Äôm saying espn, sports center, and the general public like instagram comments treat Jayden daniels as a perfect prospect with no flaws",
"Nailed it subscribed üí™üèæ",
"My biggest concern is how he'll play in the face of nfl pressure.  That contact balance you mentioned is poor, and while it's good that he kept himself composed in good pockets, those pockets in the nfl aren't going to be as clean as they were in LSU.  I mean jeepers, just look at the pass pro he's getting on these passing highlights, consistently getting 3.5+ seconds to throw with clean windows, and that's just not gonna happen in the nfl.",
"Yeah the LSU line was top 3 and a finalist for the Joe Moore Award",
"It‚Äôs hard to predict how well qbs will take on pressure. That‚Äôs just something u work on and adjust in the nfl. Go look at Justin Herbert college tap, I would have never projected him to be player that can win with a crowded pocket.",

"@@omarmiller6038to be honest I think Herbert was a completely different player in and out of college. Nobody could have predicted this level of success based off his film at Oregon haha",
"I guess it depends on the situation he gets drafted in. If he has safety valves where he has coaches who can scheme guys open with options at the middle of the field, have a run game to take the heat off (along with Jayden as a designated runner) and little ways to throw off defenses from getting to their ideal late down passing pressure looks, it could work for Daniels for his rookie year.",
"2:53 this is one of saban 7 coverages the cb uptop is probably in a meg technique and the backer probably has 2 out and vert and the safety brackets anything vertical and the bottom half of the split field coverage it‚Äôs meg on the outside but the nickel/star is probably walling off and if two is vertical the safety takes him",
"He‚Äôs got the tools, and the intelligence. Hopefully he can get into a system that‚Äôs going to develop him further, he definitely has the highest ceiling of the class",

I‚Äôm wondering if he was close to being your QB1 for this class, and what are some of the things that have you keep Caleb ahead of him?",
"Many have JD going #2, what you mean underrating?",
"Should be 1",
"I believe in Daniels as a 'safe' QB3 pick. He may not improve as crazy as Williams or Maye's size to go with his arm potential. But the mobility is definitely great along with his high floor consistency he's displayed as a passer. Certainly a talent you can confidently give a 2nd contract/extension beyond his rookie year. Probably needs some consistent weapons throughout his rookie contract to keep his high floor production.",
"Jayden has a killer release on him and you can really see it during his Pro Day (PD).  I‚Äôve been saying it‚Äôs like having nearly the arm of Marino and nearly the wheels of Lamar.  If that‚Äôs right he should be rated higher because he‚Äôll be a terror for NFL defenses to stop.",
"Gonna be honest these draft videos are so useful to evaluate prospects",
"Washington fan here. Back in January I took my first look at Drake Maye and didn't love him. Then I saw Jayden Daniels and that's my guy.",
"If I was Chicago I would draft Daniels over Williams. That being said Williams falls to the team formerly known as  the skins @ #2 and then Drake Maye goes to NE @ #3. I think as a cowboys fan I rather face Williams or Maye twice a year for 5 years ish then Daniels.",
"Im a Washington fan too. I live in AZ. When I first saw JD5 at ASU I knew he was special. Then after the Haskins failure in 2020, I been clamoring for JD5. Obviously im estatic",
"He‚Äôs awesome. But what about his average NFL arm? That concerns me a bit especially if he gets one RG3 leg injury away from less scramble ability.",
"RG3 was never this talented of a passer. He had a great deep ball, but everything else he struggled with. He was also an all world athlete and tried to run too much and took too many hits. The Shanahan's are the only reason RG3 had any success in the NFL.",
"‚Äã@brandondillman5841 Jayden rushed over a 1,000 yards when he doesn't have to with an elite o-line and 2 top WRs. He can't do that in the NFL.",
"@@samuelblackwell3762 He has to pretty great WR's. Mclaurin is elite and Dotson is a phenomenal route runner with great hands. The offense he's going to run is going to spread out the defense a ton. As long as he gets the ball out fast to his playmakers he should be fine. Daniels biggest weakness is his unwillingness to slide when he's running. Can't be taking massive hits in the NFL at his size.",
"Yeah, Jayden is my QB2...... Didn't know how they dropping this guy",

"@@wpl8275 the very first time I saw Lamar Jackson I knew I was watching a special talent. I was literally telling people he‚Äôs a better Michael Vick. Loved Lamar at Louisville. I do not see that with Jayden Daniels. He‚Äôs more polished so I think that‚Äôs what people love. The natural power, athleticism, instincts, arm talent, arm angles, vision on the move is so much better with Lamar. Don‚Äôt even mention the fact Lamar did what he did at 19 and not 23. I see Lamar as the much more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù talent, while Jayden is the more experienced polished player. Jayden is borderline if Mac Jones ran a 4.4 lol. I‚Äôm big on instincts and reactionary skills when projecting to the next level. It‚Äôs why I loved Jordan love and did not like Justin fields. I like Jayden a lot more than fields tho.

Although there are reports that Kliffs like Daniels because of his ‚ÄúAir Raid‚Äù type of offence.  Honestly who really knows lol it‚Äôs fun to debate and talk about though.  I can see them going either way",
"After 5 years",
"@@travisoshea Yea all speculation, everyone coming up with own reason why for x. The only one I buy to some degree is Cliff stuff. We really won‚Äôt know until Thursday.   Think most we‚Äôre going off past experiences say with Adam most his stops he had very traditional pocket passer, except for one Trey Lance. Which was bad luck with injuries and never fully developing. I blame Kyle for some of that no matter how big your QB why smash him up the middle constantly. Injuries slowed any development he could‚Äôve had. Then they got lucky with Brock which was the end of Lance. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised he goes with experience over boom/ bust potential in Maye. Thats was one of the reasons Brock was successful he was 4 year starter with his own ups and downs, but claimness to his game early set him up for success.   DQ inherited Matt in ATL but was the DC in Seattle for years with Russell. So he definitely seen both work.",

"@@maskedman5657he had one break out season but also he had 2 really terrible years",
"If he goes to a team with a great supporting cast and sits for a year, sure. But most teams aren't in that situation. Teams at the top of the draft want a guy who can contribute right away. Not wait a year and hope Maye fixes all his issues.",

"I GOT A PHOTO WITH HIM IN THE HOSPITAL",
"Daniels put up 17 of his passing TD in 3 games against Grambling, Georgia State, and Army.....if you want to lead off talking stats.  With all time loaded WR pair and great OT play he put up a passing season generally on par with Maye's freshman season.  Better INT but about the same otherwise particularly considering the cupcake stats that were included this year.  The difference being one guy was a first year starter and the other was in his 5th year of college with a stellar supporting cast.  The video led off talking about statistics and to me you can't say statistics point to Daniels being the better option.  There could be other arguments sure.",
"I feel likes hes gonna do good in the league",

"Anybody else here that Alex likes Jayden? Didn‚Äôt seem like a QB he‚Äôd like‚Ä¶",
"In a draft where there is no franchise QB in my view, I too had Jayden Daniels as the #2 QB behind J.J. McCarthy (begrudgingly). While I am impressed that you were able to find some good in him, your cons (or some would say knitpicks) of him is why I don't see him as a game changer in the pros. BUT... he could be another C.J. Stroud, who I also had as the #2 QB last year (begrudgingly). As you have stated and as most football cognoscenti and aficionados have said, these college systems make it very hard to evaluate the QB position. He needs to gain some weight immediately after Rookie Minicamp, and I also thought that if he was what most people claim he is, then LSU should've made the awful College Football playoffs this past season. He his no Joe Burrow, or Andrew Luck as we know, and hell I don't even see any Steve McNair in him. But IF, he goes to a team with quality coaching like how C.J. Stroud did under Bobby Slowik, then I don't mind being wrong. Good luck to him, because if he does go to the Commanders, Kliff Kingsbury is going to ruin him!",

WAS seems to always have inept people making all their decisions. Always. Did you hear their weak excuse for trading Howell away? Why even bother saying anything if that's what you're gonna say? & this is consistent too. They use D.C. political rhetoric that doesn't even make sense in any context for every thing they do wrong & they keep doing everything wrong. I think there's a chance he goes to the Giants. Once GMs lay down their plans for This Year they are ordered to look at next year. If they did this, they will realize something: no good QB prospects are slated for next year. If you don't get a QB _this_ year, you won't get one for at least two. So seeing that, all 6 QBs may go in the top-10. The Pats might not wish to trade down if doing so means having Zappe or Brissett as their starter for two full years. The Giants & Jets may not need a QB *this year,* but can't afford to take the chance they can't get one *next* year.

If both qb's switched around their timelines would Daniels be in the league still because Trey Lance is barely in the league currently.",
"Here's what I don't get about the Maye vs Daniels debate: why are people acting like Daniels is far and away better than Maye when both are obviously some level of project players with serious upside?

Plus, if Maye does need to start for a team that earned a top 5 pick last year, I think he'd do better than Daniels in that situation cuz he has experience with a subpar supporting cast.",

"Respect for telling the SEC's lawyers to go fuck themselves",
"Furry porn!",
"I believe in Daniels as a 'safe' QB3 pick. He may not improve as crazy as Williams or Maye's size to go with his arm potential. But the mobility is definitely great along with his high floor consistency he's displayed as a passer. Certainly a talent you can confidently give a 2nd contract/extension beyond his rookie year. Probably needs some consistent weapons throughout his rookie contract to keep his high floor production.",
"I have Maye in front of Daniels solely due to his higher potential, but Daniels is a solid pick. He‚Äôs (imo) the most refined QB in this draft and a dangerous runner, but has a weaker arm, a slender build, runs out of the pocket more than I‚Äôd prefer with high sack pressure-to-sack and scramble rates to back that up, and is doing all of this with a top oline and elite receivers. Daniels has the lower floor, Maye has the higher ceiling, matters what you want. Really I think it‚Äôll come down to whoever goes to Washington has a chance, and whoever goes to the Pats will get crushed.",
"I'd take him at number one.",
"Yeah, Jayden is my QB2...... Didn't know how they dropping this guy",
"I‚Äôm just concerned on him because he played with such a good core around him here, that oline there is giving him so much time",
"Team Jayden Daniels hurts his draft stock more than his play.",
"In a draft where there is no franchise QB in my view, I too had Jayden Daniels as the #2 QB behind J.J. McCarthy (begrudgingly). While I am impressed that you were able to find some good in him, your cons (or some would say knitpicks) of him is why I don't see him as a game changer in the pros. BUT... he could be another C.J. Stroud, who I also had as the #2 QB last year (begrudgingly). As you have stated and as most football cognoscenti and aficionados have said, these college systems make it very hard to evaluate the QB position. He needs to gain some weight immediately after Rookie Minicamp, and I also thought that if he was what most people claim he is, then LSU should've made the awful College Football playoffs this past season. He his no Joe Burrow, or Andrew Luck as we know, and hell I don't even see any Steve McNair in him. But IF, he goes to a team with quality coaching like how C.J. Stroud did under Bobby Slowik, then I don't mind being wrong. Good luck to him, because if he does go to the Commanders, Kliff Kingsbury is going to ruin him!",
"@AlexRollinsNFL you have Jayden as the clear QB2 in this class, but had a ton of positives to say about him across the board and what seemed like very minor critiques. I‚Äôm wondering if he was close to being your QB1 for this class, and what are some of the things that have you keep Caleb ahead of him?",
"I can‚Äôt understand having JJ over him‚Ä¶.",
"daniels is going to be the 2nd pick.  how can he be underrated as such?",
"Daniels put up 17 of his passing TD in 3 games against Grambling, Georgia State, and Army.....if you want to lead off talking stats.  With all time loaded WR pair and great OT play he put up a passing season generally on par with Maye's freshman season.  Better INT but about the same otherwise particularly considering the cupcake stats that were included this year.  The difference being one guy was a first year starter and the other was in his 5th year of college with a stellar supporting cast.  The video led off talking about statistics and to me you can't say statistics point to Daniels being the better option.  There could be other arguments sure.",
"I agree that he should be QB2 and probably will be, anything beyond him is too risky.  he doesn't have the upside Maye does but he is less likely to bust, although he does have some scary sack numbers, he also had the best receivers",
"Alex Rollins is wrong yet again. Dude has the highest rate of bailing from the pocket out of the top 6 QBs of the draft. Doesn't throw over the middle and looks for the deep ball too often. Daniel's has boom bust written all over him. How do we keep letting this guy get away with such BS opinions",
"Almost all of the examples you're using to highlight his processing prowess are with him behind absolutely pristine pockets lol wut",
"Are you supposed to go through them with 3 defenders in your lap???????",
"He's going no later than #3. In what world is he underrated?",
"He‚Äôs awesome. But what about his average NFL arm? That concerns me a bit especially if he gets one RG3 leg injury away from less scramble ability.",
"RG3 was never this talented of a passer. He had a great deep ball, but everything else he struggled with. He was also an all world athlete and tried to run too much and took too many hits. The Shanahan's are the only reason RG3 had any success in the NFL.",
"‚Äã@brandondillman5841 Jayden rushed over a 1,000 yards when he doesn't have to with an elite o-line and 2 top WRs. He can't do that in the NFL.",
"@@samuelblackwell3762 He has to pretty great WR's. Mclaurin is elite and Dotson is a phenomenal route runner with great hands. The offense he's going to run is going to spread out the defense a ton. As long as he gets the ball out fast to his playmakers he should be fine. Daniels biggest weakness is his unwillingness to slide when he's running. Can't be taking massive hits in the NFL at his size.",
"Anybody else here that Alex likes Jayden? Didn‚Äôt seem like a QB he‚Äôd like‚Ä¶",
"Truth is, no one knows.  The rate is 50/50 at best of the qb's drafted.  All the video in the world cant say if they will, or will not succeed.",
"Savages Aubrun's defense lmao. He threw a DISGUSTING pick that game on the play you're saying he's so good at. Cherry picking clips at it's finest. I will never forgive Jayden Daniels for limiting OTM work for Malik Nabers  üò°",
"He threw 4 picks all season. Lol. He could've closed his eyes and picked a good play.",
"Title is misleading. I don‚Äôt think the nfl is underrating Jayden Daniels. I think they are fairly rating him, underrating maye, and hyper overrating JJ",
"Really like the video even though I disagree. I thought he was extremely inconsistent in full field reads ,especially doing it quickly. I also thought his accuracy was way to inconsistent. But I still really do like daniels and would use a top 15 pick on him.",
"He‚Äôs literally a stick man Justin fields. Bust 100%",

He fits in so much better with the Vikings who need run support more than anything. Maye or Mac is a better fit in D.C.",

"at the least. Once he puts some weight on, he should be unstoppable.",
"Jayden has a killer release on him and you can really see it during his Pro Day (PD).  I‚Äôve been saying it‚Äôs like having nearly the arm of Marino and nearly the wheels of Lamar.  If that‚Äôs right he should be rated higher because he‚Äôll be a terror for NFL defenses to stop.",
"He has 5 plus seconds to throw everyplay..and his ball gets there ala teddy bridgewater.",
"Dude most people have him going 2 overall. How is that underrated?",
"Should be 1",
"With these polarizing guys at QB, it really just matters where they go. If Daniels goes to a team that can't develop him, he'll fail. If they can develop him, he'll succeed.",
"There is no way Drake Maye goes at 2 right no way right",
"I hope Maybe goes to number 2. I also hope Jayden pulls an Eli Manning if they are stupid to draft him at number 2.",
"Saints should draft him",
"the cover two man play around minute 2:30 was obviously two man because the defenders werent staring at the qb not that hard",
"I‚Äôve seen enough. He will be a star in the league",
"QB4",
"My biggest concern is how he'll play in the face of nfl pressure.  That contact balance you mentioned is poor, and while it's good that he kept himself composed in good pockets, those pockets in the nfl aren't going to be as clean as they were in LSU.  I mean jeepers, just look at the pass pro he's getting on these passing highlights, consistently getting 3.5+ seconds to throw with clean windows, and that's just not gonna happen in the nfl.",
"Yeah the LSU line was top 3 and a finalist for the Joe Moore Award",
"It‚Äôs hard to predict how well qbs will take on pressure. That‚Äôs just something u work on and adjust in the nfl. Go look at Justin Herbert college tap, I would have never projected him to be player that can win with a crowded pocket.",
"@@omarmiller6038the translation of sacks is there",
"@@omarmiller6038to be honest I think Herbert was a completely different player in and out of college. Nobody could have predicted this level of success based off his film at Oregon haha",
"I guess it depends on the situation he gets drafted in. If he has safety valves where he has coaches who can scheme guys open with options at the middle of the field, have a run game to take the heat off (along with Jayden as a designated runner) and little ways to throw off defenses from getting to their ideal late down passing pressure looks, it could work for Daniels for his rookie year.",
"Gonna be honest these draft videos are so useful to evaluate prospects",
"Patriots would be foolish if they pass on Daniels.",
"And who would Daniels be throwing to? I'm sure Jayden doesn't want to be Mac Jones 2.0.",
"I just can‚Äôt get over the skinny - mid arm- won‚Äôt throw on the run- play strength issues becoming a star in the nfl. But enough people love him that I have to be missing something",
"He will be on a heavy protein diet for the next 6 months. Once he gets his weight up to 225, he will be a beast.",
"@@RealPackCat I don‚Äôt see those instincts the best QBs have AT ALL. But lots of people love him. Let‚Äôs hope for my commander‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôm wrong",
"Tell me who was the league MVP last season? Some guy named Lamar Jackson, right. What was he but some skinny mid arm runner QB. And everyone like you said he would never make it in the league.",
"@@wpl8275 the very first time I saw Lamar Jackson I knew I was watching a special talent. I was literally telling people he‚Äôs a better Michael Vick. Loved Lamar at Louisville. I do not see that with Jayden Daniels. He‚Äôs more polished so I think that‚Äôs what people love. The natural power, athleticism, instincts, arm talent, arm angles, vision on the move is so much better with Lamar. Don‚Äôt even mention the fact Lamar did what he did at 19 and not 23. I see Lamar as the much more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù talent, while Jayden is the more experienced polished player. Jayden is borderline if Mac Jones ran a 4.4 lol. I‚Äôm big on instincts and reactionary skills when projecting to the next level. It‚Äôs why I loved Jordan love and did not like Justin fields. I like Jayden a lot more than fields tho. Hope this makes sense",
"Lamar has one of the strongest arms in the league. ‚Äã@@wpl8275",
"Many have JD going #2, what you mean underrating?",
"Should be 1",
"Dude will probably get a big 10 month injury year one.... He too skinny to be playing hero ball the way he does.... I'd Try to trade back, pick up Bowers, then get Jordan Travis later.... Let him sit a year, and be bad with Mariota.... Maybe even double up on qb.... You want Jaden on the internet crying about the team that drafted him? If I draft him, I'm drafting the back up plan to him too....",
"Im pretty sure the only reason he's rated behind Drake Maye is because he had one breakout year which was his last.",
"And also there have been many reports that Quinn likes his size more.",
"@@travisosheaI haven‚Äôt seen that I‚Äôve heard him talk about Maye a few times. Main things he said was he athletic and off script stuff. Called Jayden a playmaker and very polished and makes quick decisions no matter the defense.",
"@@terencebarnes7393 yea I‚Äôve heard a lot about Maye going to Washington because he‚Äôs a lot like Matt Ryan which Quinn had in ATL.  Although there are reports that Kliffs like Daniels because of his ‚ÄúAir Raid‚Äù type of offence.  Honestly who really knows lol it‚Äôs fun to debate and talk about though.  I can see them going either way",
"After 5 years",
"@@travisoshea Yea all speculation, everyone coming up with own reason why for x. The only one I buy to some degree is Cliff stuff. We really won‚Äôt know until Thursday.   Think most we‚Äôre going off past experiences say with Adam most his stops he had very traditional pocket passer, except for one Trey Lance. Which was bad luck with injuries and never fully developing. I blame Kyle for some of that no matter how big your QB why smash him up the middle constantly. Injuries slowed any development he could‚Äôve had. Then they got lucky with Brock which was the end of Lance. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised he goes with experience over boom/ bust potential in Maye. Thats was one of the reasons Brock was successful he was 4 year starter with his own ups and downs, but claimness to his game early set him up for success.   DQ inherited Matt in ATL but was the DC in Seattle for years with Russell. So he definitely seen both work.",
"He‚Äôs the second pick. Wtf???? Clickbait",
"Most mock drafts have Maye as the second pick",
"I just dont know if hes quarterbacky enough. I like my my quarterbacks to be more quarterbacky! ü§ì Preferably stealing money from poor people or being accused of some other disgusting crime!",
"The one thing about Daniels is I know people say he's a one year wonder and there is some truth to that but context is important. He had a good freshman season at ASU, I'm an ASU fan so watched every game, but his sophomore year was 2020, Covid year. That year was basically a lost year for development as they had mostly freshmen wide receivers, they played USC in the opening game, then went almost a month before playing again and they only played 4 games total. We saw some initial signs of trouble in 2020 that we just chalked up to Covid but 2021 was revealing as that was one of the worst coaching jobs we've ever seen at ASU. Go look at that 2021 ASU roster, guys like Pearsall, Johnny Wilson, several guys getting drafted plus a few more NFL guys were on that roster. ASU arguably had the most talented roster every game they played in that season and they struggled all year. Don't let the record or final scores of some of those games fool you, they struggled to beat bad teams, only beat one good team, lost to other good teams, heavily penalized, no discipline, had recruiting violations hanging over their head, it was a miserable season in which most of us wanted Edwards fired because we knew the final record of that team was a mirage.  Jayden goes to LSU and improves dramatically with some stability and good coaching. He still has some of the same issues he had at ASU but he also improved a lot both years so while he seems like a one year wonder, he also spent his first three years under a poor coaching staff.",
"There was another one year wonder at LSU. Look at how that turned out.",
"@@theacgkidFr. Ppl treat Jayden daniels like the perfect prospect cuz he went to lsu and won the Heisman which is respected by most football fans. You can find ppl calling out cons of other qb prospects like Caleb, drake, penix, nix, and jj but nobody comments anything bad abt Jayden. Like I can name 5 things that will not work out for Jayden in the league. Main problem for me about him is he just runs into defenders and his body size wouldn‚Äôt allow him to take those hits in the nfl.",
"So he‚Äôs a 2 year wonder",
"@@Cowgirls9ershaterNaw he definitely gets criticized. I say if you just watch ESPN probably not, but other places like PFF, Bleacher Report, Ringer, the Athletic are much lower on him. They all prefer Maye by wide margin. My issue is they do the same thing. They see Maye as best prospect since Trevor outside Caleb and some have him ahead of Caleb. You rarely hear any of his issues as prospect. Only when you watch ex QBs and ex coaches you hear his issues. He misses far too many easy throws and slides into pressure in pocket, making a bad line worse.   Coaches and ex players are just higher on Jayden because he ready to play tomorrow. I really only his size, and his arm isn‚Äôt elite, but ok. I rather average arm that make all the throws and accurate consistently.",
"@@terencebarnes7393 Not high on drake maye either tbh. But yeah I‚Äôm saying espn, sports center, and the general public like instagram comments treat Jayden daniels as a perfect prospect with no flaws",
"The teams that pass up on this kid will suffer the consequences.  He did not become the heisman winner on accident.  I know the Bears are taking Caleb and I believe he will work, but this kid is also going to I think.",

Not because of anti-WAS memes but because Cliff I need to teach Kyler Murray how to be a Pocket Passer because I can't wrap my mind around out of structure QBs Kingsbury is their HC. _AND_ they hired Dan Quinn as HC? Oy. The Chargers Charger. The Browns became the Ravens & Draft Specialists in BAL. Then the new Browns came up & with a 100% different staff became as terrible as the old ones at drafting. WAS seems to always have inept people making all their decisions. Always. Did you hear their weak excuse for trading Howell away? Why even bother saying anything if that's what you're gonna say? & this is consistent too. They use D.C. political rhetoric that doesn't even make sense in any context for every thing they do wrong & they keep doing everything wrong. I think there's a chance he goes to the Giants. Once GMs lay down their plans for This Year they are ordered to look at next year. If they did this, they will realize something: no good QB prospects are slated for next year. If you don't get a QB _this_ year, you won't get one for at least two. So seeing that, all 6 QBs may go in the top-10. The Pats might not wish to trade down if doing so means having Zappe or Brissett as their starter for two full years. The Giants & Jets may not need a QB *this year,* but can't afford to take the chance they can't get one *next* year.
