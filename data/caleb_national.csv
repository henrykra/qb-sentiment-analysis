"Be careful criticizing Cowherd. My comment got deleted 🤣",
"@@WakeandBlake_420 oh I’m sure my comments got deleted off Cowherd’s actual channel. As a Bears fan, I was cracking jokes on Cowherd the second he mentioned this stupidity yesterday. Then what do you know, Cowherd walked it all back less than a day later and still tried to pretend like he was the smartest guy in the room. What a 🤡",
"Cowherd was the same person that criticized all the Texans offseason moves",
"No legit he said Texans were making smart low key moves last year.",
"Cowherd is indeed a freaking joke",
"Oh he ripped us apart called CJ dumb. Said it would never work",
"All these talking heads are the same.",

"Wrong. He said Caleb’s camp called him and said he doesn’t want to be PORTRAYED as anti-Chicago. The concerns you heard from Caleb’s camp are entirely real",
"The rise and fall of Caleb Williams will be epic and I'm here for it",
"I don't understand the haters. Is it just because he's a USC QB? It's a lazy argument. First off, Palmer was a good pro. But it's also the same narrative CJ had as an OSU QB and Rodgers as a Tedford guy. You gotta isolate the player. He has all the tools..elite arm, off platform throwing, downfield accuracy, calm under pressure..unlike Z Wilson and others, he keeps his body square and fluid when he breaks the pocket, he's not Lamar, but he's got wheels. He won a Heisman 2 yrs removed from HS and was also great as true freshman at OU. He has the production to match the talent. He only had 1 bad game vs ND. Aside from that, he was either solid to amazing. I just think a lot of fans like to be contrarians because he has the media hype. Every scout imaginable has the unanimous opinion he's the #1 QB. They do this professionally and often have differing opinions. I've watched him plenty myself and I used to do draft coverage with Bleacher Report. He's a fantastic prospect.",

"Why are we spoon fed how sure of a shot Caleb is? I see nothing about him more sure than any other recent top quarterback, and beyond that he has a TON of red flags before we even get to Indianapolis to see him. He whines, he cries, family baggage, huge ego, teams he won't play for, % of ownership desire.... the list goes on. I have a feeling he's going to be Zack Wilson level humbled. I don't want him on my team one bit, and we need a quarterback, not a spoiled child.",

"Buckeyes connection there, too. I can’t argue with anything here. well said.",
"Exactly",
"Taking Harrison first would be the dumbest move possible. You have the 1st pick. If you’re not drafting Caleb or May with the 1st pick you have to trade that pick. You can get another 1 plus multiple picks min. Maybe even 2 more 1s",

"@@Chris-qh5tz He's the best WR to come out of the draft in the last 10 years... that's not cute it's smart to pick him. DJ Moore did wonders for Justin, give him another weapon on the other side, and draft O line at 9. That's what I think they should do as a Jets fan from the outside looking in.  If you can get a haul for #1 go for it, but it would be hard for me to pass up on marvelous marv.",
"Umm Colin Cowherd said that Caleb’s camp told him they don’t want to be painted as anti-Chicago?? Does Pat or anyone on his crew actually watch when people say this stuff or do they just read the tweet of a headline of a report of what Colin actually said?",

"You can't do it, but it would improve the game.",
"Bears could still pick QB at 1 then.",
"It’s not a rule because it shouldn’t need to be. I think it’s obvious that if you want a fresh-into-the-nfl young QB, you want to have a solid O line so he’s not gettin destroyed and getting his confidence ruined. Weird how a lot of teams still make that mistake. Maybe even more so now and in the future with mobile QBs being the norm in todays NFL, and GMs trusting that their guy is athletic and improvisational enough to get out of the pocket regularly.",

"I remember people talking about Jamis Winston like this .....",
"I get the history regarding Bears qbs but like the team won 7 games. The next 4 teams didn't win more than 5 games. A team that didnt get eliminated from playoffs until w17 having 1st pick is insane",

Get drafted by the Bears who have a solid WR1, will use the draft and free agency to get you a good WR2 fix the oline and solidify a top 10 defense. There’s probably not gonna be too many holes in Chicago after free agency and the draft.  Or 2. Some team pulls a Carolina and gives up the world to draft you. Now you’re going to a team that may have better history with QBs but now you probably have a crappy wr room and/or bad oline, and no future picks because they were all given away for Caleb.   There are no other options.",

Will grab a QB but I think the first QB off the broad is Penix not Williams. Unless a team moves up and grabs a runningback that they need badly. Which the Chargers needs a young stud Runningback. Look for Jim to move up and grab one of his old Runningbacks from Michigan",

"Yes Caleb Shrewd move homie Talk your way into the 6th spot  The NYG's NEED YOU",
"Chicago is where QBs go to die.",
"John Elway said he didn’t want to play for the Baltimore Colts in the 1983 draft. No one made a big deal about it or thought it would apply to other things. Caleb’s just doing what Elway did & it seemed to work out for Elway.",
"DC bound!!!",
"I mean aren’t most people expecting the bears to trade their #1 considering they probably aren’t drafting a QB anyway? It’s not 100% for sure that Fields will be gone.",
"Both times player has mad a team trade him manning and Elway they both won super bowls where they went so I guess they were right",
"Cowherd 🗑️",
"Caleb > JF1 > Drake Maye > Rest of draft. Bears need to decide between Jf1 and Caleb.  If they dont think Caleb will work out, then trade that pick and get a haul to improve the rest of the team",
"Why does anyone praise Colin Cowherd?  He's an idiot, and his hot takes are garbage unless you're also an idiot.  Lol.",
"Funny how the media always complain about hands on BLK fathers and mothers (Lamar’s). But didn’t say nothing about father Manning and Bosa. The complaints of these complaining white voices is becoming excessive and repetitive. It might be time to tune in elsewhere that’s less negative to hands on fathers",
"please bears trade away that #1 pick",
"LOVE USC AND LOVE CALEB WILLIAMS......THIS IS A SMART MAN!!! ha ha ha ha    Da Bears ARE TRASH",
"The bears Ryan poles keep fields Caleb said he don't want to be picked by da bears 🐻",
"You can already tell what you are going to have to deal with if you draft this kid. Bears would be smart to pass it up.",
"Caleb seems entitled af.",
"Eli, Elway, Bo, Tom Cousineau ( OSU LB who spurned Buffalo for the CFL in 1979 )",
"Cowherd is a lair full of bull but since I am a Bear 🐻 fan I wouldn't take that Qb ! He burned himself saying he better than Patrick Mahomes he made me laugh ! He another Johnny football Sucks Big Time pass no thanks! Justin Fields is are Qb",
"The thing about this situation is that the Bears #1 pick becomes less valuable if Caleb publicly doesn’t want to go there. They might be better off selecting him and then trading him away. Even if they did though, they’d have a harder time getting the player they want.",
"Who takes Colins takes seriously? He said Adam Gase was the next Kyle Shanahan 😂😂",
"Cowherd is an absolute moron. Him and schefter are absolute slime balls",
"I don't see anything special about him all I see is red flags he's going to be a bust chicago fan hear we don't want him",
"If true, I can’t blame him! 😂😂",
"Caleb is SOOOO OVERRATED!!!",
"Only thing is that his “camp” is that it is his dad. If you are the Bears why wouldn’t you trade it away? Fields is decent he just needs an Oline, and a consistent  coaching staff.",
"Whoever drafts him will have their hands full dealing with him and his dad, both a pain in the ass",
"Crazy how stroud and Williams both qbs passing up on Chicago using Justin Fields as scape goat to save themselves being drafted to Chicago",
"Colin did the same thing when Zion was the number one pick. Same exact thing. I like Colin but his attempts at manipulating the markets are wild",
"drafting caleb williams is a terrible idea for the bears… they should trade the first pick to get more picks",
"We don't want him",
"Cowherd just likes to listen to himself talk",
"Just don't somehow end up on the pats please.",
"He didn't want to go to Arizona either.",
"two 15 second adds that are not skippable is criminal",
"Sports media is the once place where smoke can just mean smoke. Justin Fields bitched about the weather. It means nothing.",
"Caleb Williams will be eaten alive by the Chicago media......",
"Draft his princess ass and trade him.  Eli Manning knows",
"I don't think Caleb is gonna be that good,I could be wrong but I don't see it.",
"I would not go to Chicago either",
"Williams is a bust",
"Invite Caleb to your show!",
"Fields can’t read",
"Caleb Williams has Ryan Leaf written all over him. He's a nutcase, with nutty parents, and his USC teammates didn't like him.  Stay away.  None of this year's QBs are locks to be ultra-successful in the NFL, although Drake Maye probably has the best shot.",
"USC has a lot of qb flops",
"Caleb to Chicago with that horrible line.😮  He don't want that neverending nightmare.😂",
"Good we dont want him either",
"Caleb is too short and a crybaby.  The Bear fans don't want you either.",
"as a bears fan i dont want caleb.",
"No one wants to be a Bear trust me",
"I wonder how many participation trophies Caleb has in his bedroom.",
"I still don’t get the hype around him but I’m ready to see what he can do on the NFL",
"Cowherd is an idiot.... “Several signs say Jordan Love is a little more than a backup. Green Bay’s coach Matt LaFleur warned us multiple times in the off-season to temper our enthusiasm. They didn’t do that with Burrow, Herbert, or Mahomes. Watch how Green Bay coaches him. They don’t trust him and it’s hyper-conservative. They’d rather not throw. Analytics and data prove he is AWFUL in the first half. Can’t be a good quarterback if you’re always trailing, and Jordan Love can’t play it trailing and win games. Even on-script he’s bad. Simply put, he cannot throw it down the field accurately.",
"Bs…🤧",
"Idk why people hate on Caleb Williams. People just be filled with jealousy and envy when they see other talented people",
"I luv dat da worst’s player or the greatest it’s a damn shame",
"I said this about Johnny and baker.  They would both end up beings divas.  This guy is just like it.  Idk why they college kids act like they can make that decision.  If I was the nfl don't draft this kid.",
"Rumor is there was gossip coming out of the nail salon Caleb goes to.",
"I have absolutely no clue why this dude is a higher prospect than luck, manning, burrow, Lawrence, or most guys. Theres serious questions if he is even the 2nd best prospect in this draft alone!",
"My boi Pat is going get a lawsuit from Colin Cowherd very soon! 🤣🤣🤣",
"Funny how all the white folk didn’t have the same energy for Eli Manning",
"Cowterd is a liar. Plain and simple.",
"Look at what Fields puts up with from Bears fans. When they win they praise the defense. When they lose they blame Fields the same way they'll blame Caleb.",
