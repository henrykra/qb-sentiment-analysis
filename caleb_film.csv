"I’m a packers fan, y’all can build your team like the Dolphins did, but with better results, trade down keep that DJ Moore Trade paying dividends, and bolster the team. You still pick at 9, there are a ton of WRs this draft too (including guys to be a number 2 to Moore). Give Fields a contending roster, we will perform (he showed that towards the end of last season)",
"@@kghostthegreat Tua is way better than Fields, and he hasn’t even proven he’s good enough to win",
"@@Bruce-oe2ie Tua also never had Fields’ upside, With Tua alleys having those physical limitations that would hold him back. He’s a good NFL QB but not a game-changing player. Would not be shocked if the Dolphins move on in 5 or so years.  Fields has every tool necessary to succeed (and if you recall it took Tua 3 seasons to actually look like an adequate starter in the NFL).The Bears FINALLY are out of the area of having one of the worst rosters in football. To keep from doing that, you want as many blue chip prospects on the building as you can get. We act like they don’t also have the *No. 9 pick* so they still have a high pick to take that guy. This also allows them to have assets in the future (whether this works out or not)",

"@@ektran4205  probably not",
"@@ektran4205 I like Waldron as a hire for the offense. What I'm not as sold on is Eberflus and developing a consistent top 10 defense. Jim Schwartz took a Browns defense group that was underachieving and made them a top 5 group. Hell even Brian Flores took a defensive roster that I'd argue is below average and gave them a high floor against opposing offenses/QBs who can't fully punish blitzes. Sure 'Flus got his edge player in Sweat but the trenches and DBs still need more talent.",

"My favorite time of year, when Alex Rollins starts making scouting report videos. Been looking forward to this since the NFL ended",
"Thanks brother!",
"I think it’s important to not overthink it with Caleb Williams. He’s got arm to make every throw. He’s got the athleticism to scramble and get yardage. He can make big plays when things break down. Hell, he HAD to. USC’s offensive line, receivers, and defense did him little to no favors, and the Trojans probably go below .500 without him. The only real flaw in his game is his over reliance on playing hero ball. If he can learn to settle down and play with more poise and toughness, he’ll be a star.",
"Absolutely. Dude is a special talent. Obviously he still has room to develop, but most rookie QBs do. Idk why everybody expects him to be perfect coming out of college",
"Bingo",
"@@WFM True, and also, people need to stop with the finger nails and the crying. Teenagers/young adults do stupid shit all the time, and crying is nothing to be ashamed of nor make fun of. According to his teammates and coaches, he was a good teammate and leader. That’s all I need.",
"@@WFM Because he is a polarizing player and he was being called generational for a time. I still think he can get to that top 5 QB level in a few years but there will be pumps in the road in his rookie year.",
"​@@Dawg-Bone glazing",
"The playmaking instincts are magical.  Lots to work on but you don’t pass on a player with this kind of wow factor and raw ability.    The fumbles are absolutely a concern. Can’t put the ball on the ground.",
"I think the fumbles may be in part that he had to play hero ball most of the time with how sub par the team talent was around Williams. So there was definitely more pressure for him to get things right even for situations where there really was no answer because he's on a pass script, his receivers aren't helping and the opposing defense has him dead to rights. Mans had to play into high variance just to turn water to wine and make things work out in the end.",
"@@t4d0Wsubpar talent????😭😭😭😭",
"⁠@@gginthechat7559usc was by far subpar talent wise this year anyone who watched knows he didn’t throw to any first round talents this year (maybe rice) in comparison to other qb prospects and his defense gave up about 40pts a game I think that alone you could call that a subpar team, stars don’t mean anything once you get to college imo",
"@@pinkpolorico8656 you are talking about lack of talent utilization. That is true for usc unfortunately. But best believe that team doesn’t have “subpar talent”",
"I think both things can be true as I think about it this usc team did have studs outside of Caleb for sure (Branch,Lloyd and DT Alexander come to mind ) and the coaching staff really didn’t utilize the talent outside of Caleb to the best potential but I still believe the Oline and Dline as a whole was very mediocre and below average",
"Great material but to be precise, his base problem when dropping back isn't dropping back itself, this does not affect base. It is the fact that his backfoot is not underneath his right shoulder when he winds up for the throw. That means, he does not have a way to shift his weight from back to front when throwing, because his weight is already on the front. That takes away throwing power from the hip completely and leaves him with the body and arm throw, which hurts like hell, doesn't support longevity of the shoulder and is overall less accurate.",
"Fortunately its coachable and can very easily be fixed",
"Ya the bears have proven they coach bad habits outta quarterbacks pretty well",
"This is great, Alex. Would you also be able to make one for Maye as well? I feel like I haven’t been able to find good breakdowns on him yet.  Keep up the great work.",

"@@AlexRollinsNFL 😂😂😂😂",
"Great content Alex! Nailed it as far as he can do it but can he be consistent. The only thing I can't understand is why people keep talking about interceptions being a concern. The guy threw 14int in 1024att in 3years. That is just over 1%. I was impressed with his numbers against the blitz. I have seen a few breakdowns that question him in this area.",
"I love how much slower your cadence is when reciting. Listening to during your earlier videos was an extreme sport coz of how quickly you'd rattle out words which made me watch the video 2-4 times to understand what you were saying but now by the time I'm watching a vid for the fourth time, I've mastered it.",
"Thanks brother!!",
"Just because your team can't get him, you gotta dig deap and find flaws. Go Bears",
"It’s weird I watched Caleb a lot this year he reminds more of rookie year Mahomes he is always looking to extend the play and his pocket awareness is great but sometimes he’ll make his tackles job harder. Nothing coaching can’t fix if he’s a learner. Great video Alex.",
"Great video.",
"Always got me feeling those epic chills by the end of these well-made vids. Keep up the solid content",
"Thanks!",
"Cool, cool, cool. Thanks Alex!!",

"when you look at Williams' wonky footwork, how concerning is it if he has the arm to make up for it? Feel like I saw Jordan Love fade away on like half of his passes this season but it seemed to work for him",
"If Williams learns to just settle down and keep a cool head, he’ll be a star.",
"he's talented enough to start right away but I wouldn't be shocked if the bears brought in a vet to at least push him. feel like his first year might be a little challenging trying to figure out what he can and can't get away with.",
"@@saladin3452 Yeah",
"It's a potential accuracy issue but accuracy is not the issue his only issue is pressuring himself to be the hero and struggling to stay in structure.",
"Patrick Mahomes had zero footwork coming out of college so I’m not too concerned tbh",
"Great spotlight. Excited to see what he can do at the NFL level. Bears have cap space, and the first two picks in the draft with Caleb being a great prospect. If they can't turn it around in this situation, then they just might be cursed.",
"Thanks TLD!",
"Great video, thx. If you were the GM for the Bears which QB are YOU taking? I'd take Daniles, myself.",
"I hope we see some analyzation videos on some WRs. Maybe Rome Odunze, Brenden Rice, Xavier Legette, Keon Coleman, Luke McCaffrey, etc",
"He's the best college prospect I've ever seen since Andrew Luck, if not ever. He has Mahomes level arm talent, pocket presence, and is shiftier.  Caleb gets to the bottom of his drop without clicking his feet and keeps a wide base throughout the play, letting him be ready to throw the ball at any point. Andrew Luck is the best QB I've ever seen at climbing the pocket and the way Caleb does it is reminiscent of it.",
"Always happy to see ND film on here :)",
"Love the vid Alex, sent you an email btw.",
"Thanks brother! Which email did you send it to?",
"@AlexRollinsNFL where do you get this film from?",
"It always comes down to the if. Preparation processing performance.",
"Or, at 4:20 does Caleb see number 9 and wait till he can’t block or intercept his pass.",
"I think there is no question of Williams superior QB attributes, but my question is this: Did any of his USC teammates even show up to his birthday party? He sort of reminds me of a much more talented Josh Rosen.",
"His anticipation is strongly lacking.  I didn't get to see as much of this team as I would've liked during the season, so I appreciate your breakdown.  He's got solid physical skills, but he needs to get the ball out quicker, especially since the windows will be smaller, and close faster, at the League level.",
"jayden daniels against the blitz 17 tds 0 int.",
"Anything can happen, obviously....but to not see this guy as a LIKELY bust from a mile away is pretty amazing. Unless he matures LIKE CRAZY, I predict a 1% chance that his career is more Mahomes than Manziel.",
"there has to be some prejudice to this take cause there is 0 reason to view him as a likely bust",
"He’s got no fundamentals.  All arm. No footwork. 84 career fumbles. Lots of interceptions.  He should not be any teams starting QB.   He does not like the bears, so hopefully he will end up somewhere else.",
"⁠@@specialist-in-tech”he throws a lot of interception” bro has thrown 14 int’s in three seasons/ to 93 touchdowns thrown. “does not like the bears” no evidence of him saying that, why are you so miserable you just like to spread misinformation? Unless you are just very gullible and believe everything you see ?",
"This guy is really bothered by the fingernails 😂  Great video though, amazing production made it easy to understand",
"Nickel blitzing will trouble him. Especially pre snap one high rolling into 2 high post snap",
"You’re the same guy that said Justin Herbert would bust right?😂😂😂",
"at 2:52 #16 was wide open but Williams struggles to play within structure and throw with anticipation. He doesn't let it fly. #16 had his man beat, and the other DB had his back turned to the receiver. Williams is staring right at #16 and doesn't rip it. It's one of many examples of him missing open targets that he will have to hit in the NFL. Also, he has a big arm, but not a strong arm. He's not strong enough to put the velocity that's required to fit the ball into tight windows, hence why he passed up the wide open man at 2:52. He is going to need Mahomes level work on him and starting him year one will be detrimental to his development. He isn't nearly as good of a prospect as Stroud was last year.",
"Cj Stroud is that generational prospect they were talking about",
"I do not think he will translate to the NFL as a rook.",
"i mean a lot of qbs have succeeded despite trash footwork. Mahomes was very raw at texas tech, so was dak, etc.",
"mahomes had andy reid to develop him",
"i'm scared. he has issues (like every prospect) and the bears aren't exactly known for coaching up QBs",
"QB that holds onto the ball too long and… NOT AGAIN.",
"If bears are SMART they sign Flacco or Tannehill to a 1 or 2 deal. Trade fields for a 2nd. Draft Caleb and let him sit behind vet QB he can learn from. Then build skill position players and Oline through draft for the next few years and start Caleb once he is ready and team is built up.",
"What makes you think that he’s not ready to start right now???  🤔🤷🏻‍♂️🙄🤦🏻‍♂️",
"@@johnbrowntheprophet he could be ready right away, but even if he is ready day 1 why rush him into a situation where the bears Fan based will kill him if he has a bad game? The bears fans will expect IMMEDIATE success right away since you all didn’t draft mahomes but trubiksy. Also fields haven’t worked out. You know the bears fans will crucify Caleb if he isn’t great right away and call him “bust”. Let Caleb sit 1-2 yrs behind playoff qb then start him like mahomes and Jordan love did.",
"@@Unsealed_Prods - Because at some point, you have to see what you have.  🤷🏻‍♂️  Babying him won’t do any good.  Tell me how many Number One quarterback picks didn’t start right away???  How many of them sat an entire year???  🤔🤷🏻‍♂️",
"@@johnbrowntheprophet it’s not a matter of “is Caleb ready to play immediately”. The point is to make sure the TEAM is competent enough to HELP their franchise QB. Doesnt matter how good the QB is if the oline can’t block or if the receivers can’t get open. I think you’re missing my point. Let Caleb sit while the team is being built up",
"@@johnbrowntheprophet​​⁠Bruh there is no harm in letting a QB sit for a year. Chiefs did the same shit with Mahomes and he already has almost half the rings as the goat, at 28. Chill.",
"I love how people who do CW breakdowns focus on the ND game 90% of the time.",
"Well their defense is good, we can watch him tear up mediocre defenses but what would that achieve when the NFL game is faster and more punishing than even the ND game. Notice he didn't tear Williams apart, he pointed out the good and bad. Media tends to just suck him off or hate him.",
"You mention that his arm strength will be top-5 in the league, but that when off his base his arm strength suffers. Does he still have elite arm strength when off-platform a la Mahomes/Rodgers/Allen, or more of a strong arm like PFM/Drew Brees/Brady where part/most of the power comes from the feet/hips? Not disagreeing that he does obviously have arm strength, just curious what type of guy you think he is.   I hear a lot about Caleb's game being similar to Mahomes', but watching these examples he doesn't seem to have that extra godly-ness to his throws that Mahomes/Rodgers have. To me he seems a lot closer Russell Wilson.",
"Watch some more tape. Those type of throws are there.",
"I believe he'll get thrown into the fray. I agree that it would be nice to sit him and develop him. At least the Bears have but together a pro bowl caliber offense for him which gives a great chance to do well. I'm heartbroken about JF but let's see what CW can do.",
"So he needs to sit on 1 year. His talent needs to be polished, no doubt. Reading defenses, patience in the pocket, throwing accurately, they all can be improved. Can he improves it in Bears, though?",
"He very clearly struggles to read defenses well. Post snap reads and throwing with anticipation definitely needs to be worked on. The arm talent is there though for sure but he’s far from generational imo.",
"Great vid man, nice work! Sub’d",
"Thanks!",
"I'd appreciate a Justin Fields update because he's come a long way from what he showed in your previous video. His performances against Denver, Washington, Detroit (twice), and Atlanta were exhilarating to watch, and he's made it a difficult decision for the Bears front office. Keep up the good work!",
"Williams is better. The only thing Fields has over Williams is his athleticism. That’s it.",
"​@@Dawg-Bone A UGA fan hating on Fields is wild. At the same time glazing a Caleb 😂",
"​@@Dawg-Bone I never said Fields was better lol",
"@@Dimesprodza uga fan hating on Fields probably comes from how he got beaten out by Jake Fromm",
"Fields isn't good. He never was good and he never will be good. He's had 3 years to improve and hasn't",
"Yeah don’t overthink it. No one is perfext",
"I’ll never understand how many dudes think that it makes them more of a man to refuse to something because it’s “not manly” or whatever.  Pretty sure Caleb doesn’t mind if a bunch of dudes who are older than him make fun of him and his nails, or him crying on the sideline (which is something that happens in a lot of championship games across sports, btw). He’s already made more money than most will ever make through his own talent and hard work, I’m sure he could pull just about any girl he wanted, and he’s about to go first overall in the NFL draft.  My Redskins will probably end up with Maye, which I’ll be happy with—but I’d be happier than Caleb in Sephora if he ended up coming back to his hometown to sling scary Terry the rock.",
"Anybody else look at Caleb Williams and get flashbacks to the Fields conversation back in 2020? All of the tools are very similar and it's crazy that a direct comparison is not made more often",
"If Bears are smart, they'll be patient and sit him for a year. He'll get to learn at his own natural pace, mature as a man, and wont be subject to a ton of unnecessary hits in the process.    But its the Bears so we all know thats not gonna happen. Its a coinflip at best if he ever reaches his full potential in the nfl.",
"I agree with letting him sit for a year or at the very least half a year just to get more comfortable. The other thing that would help, having a good run game. We know having a solid run game helps every quarterback but for a rookie it can be particularly helpful just to give defenses something else to think about as they grow. The Bears not drafting him would be foolish because while he has some imperfections, just like every player drafted ever, you take a chance on a top notch talent who demonstrated for three years they are good. This isn't a Ryan Leaf or Jamarcus Russell who had one great year in college with a few solid seasons before, he was good to great all three years. Playing it safe rarely works in the NFL, you take great talent, build around him, coach him up and you can't worry about him being a bust because the NFL is littered with guys who were can't miss but missed along with guys with major concerns such as Justin Herbert, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes, who teams hit big with. Take your chances with great talent to reach greatness and live with the results rather than playing it safe to get the same middling results.",
"In the case of Herbert, the Chargers hit pay dirt with him but Telesco could never build a defense that could help him protect leads or get him the ball back. Even worse when Staley is also inconsistent in calling game plans especially against the run. At least Mahomes will def admit his 2024 SB is in large part credit to Spags and that Chiefs defensive group that was just elite in the playoffs even against Allen and Lamar. Teams def won't admit when they didn't do their part to help out their super star QB and their fans in some cases will still think they actually have optimal talent around their super star QB.",
"PLEASE do a Jaden Daniels video thanks",
"Video should’ve been called Caleb Williams struggles against Notre Dame",
"A college qb struggled a little with the worst defense in college? Does no one remember the clip of fields missing 3 open receivers and and sprinting into a lineman’s back? I love the kid, but seriously we have to try and draft the GREATEST prospect* in history",

"You dont think hes an authentic top fove draft pick? 😂 what?",
"@@TheBHNetwork No he means top five arm of all current NFL QBs",
"He is not going to have a better arm than Rodgers, Stafford, Allen, Mahomes, Herbert, and Burrow",
"1000th like 👍",
"i like your stuff usually but this was just a hate reel. you'd sit him in hist first year? if there is any qb you don't need to do that with it would be him...",
"It's only hate if you're choosing to watch it that way. Lots of positives pointed out here!",
"YESSIRRR!!!",
"Historically QBs who are top talent that sit instead of starting fare better. He’s either boom or bust since chances are he’s going to be thrust into starting wherever he’s going.",
"If the #1 pick isn’t going to be a top 10 player at his position, pass. Draft Harrison Jr. this year, but that ship already sailed. 🤦‍♂️",
"you roasted Jordan Love on his fundamentals and then he popped off, u're doing it to Caleb too",
"but he's still not wrong on Jordan Love. Jordan Love needs to work on his fundamentals, doesn't mean he isn't playing great because he was but he can still be greater if he cleans up his fundamentals. Mahomes was dropping too far back in the pocket a bit too often, playing hero ball more than he needed to, he improved in both areas and it made him even better. Critiques doesn't mean they're trash, just means if they fix a few small things, those small things can lead to more great things.",
"Jordan Love's fundamentals were trash, but he corrected them. His video was spot on at the time.",
"@@jamesmarshall6619 the bears dont have best qb coach in the league in tom clements or andy reid",

"Caleb Williams is the future of the NFL but he's also not a slam dunk? What? So which one is it?",
"I think he got so much backlash from the Jordan Love stinks vid that he kinda had to play both sides and let it ride.",
"LOL I mean you can be both at this point. Any top QB is gonna play second fiddle to Mahomes for the next decade anyway. The real question is can that future QB be close to that level as #15  but still beat the Chiefs everywhere else and on defense?",
"Williams is a QB Bears fans!  Not the villain which so many of you feel he is!",
"LETS GOOOOO BEAR DOWN",
"Has all day with SC O-line, looks pretty good. He won't have this time in the NFL, not on a bad team picking high. Also runs into trouble many times instead of running out of trouble. Strong arm is nice. Height isn't ideal, seems super money motivated, will likely disappoint at first, if not beyond first few years as pro. Bears kind of dumb, will get less out of Williams than Fields who hasn't had shit for a line in Chicago and has a $1.6 mil salary with $3.3 mil cap hit...f'n chiraq.",
"I'm sick of the excuses being made for JF not having a line, or his coaches suck, or whatever. What's any of that have to do with not being able to read the field and hitting the open guy when he DOES have time? Caleb is a MUCH better prospect in terms of actually playing the QB position. Everything JF got was mainly off of busted plays, or planned runs. He cost his line two-thirds of the sacks he had at least! Great dude? Yeah! Great at quarterback? No!",
"You’re a bit too obsessed with JF, I think you’re hurting your mental health",
"@@LiveLXStudios Probably right.",
"Trade down for mhj and roll with Justin and hard focus on getting lineman in the draft this year and work on the defense next season",
"There all different players of course but if i had to describe comparisons for the top 3:  CW: Josh Allen; some of the most amazing athletic  plays you will ever see in your life; super hero stuff.  Will struggle at times with the structured stuff. Good enough at seeing the field and processing but not elite; can struggle in a key game when elite defenses game plan them out of their strengths and comforts.  JD: Lamar Jackson/Jalen hurts type player. Passable processing, elite threat in the running game. Steadily developing  passing game. Very effective in offenses tailored around their strengths.   DM: Mix between JH/Maholmes. Has great tools; athleticism, arm, improv ability, at times accuracy. By far the best processor of the 3 and highest potential to become a top 3-5 qb in the league if he reaches his ceiling. Needs to work on his mechanics to improve his release and have more consistent accuracy. He demonstrates the ability to throw with anticipation. He’s not a complete product by any means but neither were Herbert or Maholmes when they came into the league. But he’s ahead of the curve at the moment.",
"Didn’t realize his footwork was this bad. Also some of this reeks of not being able to read the defense.",
"DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!!! Every year we say these kids are the future...top draft picks are NOT guaranteed",
"And also he couldn’t beat UTAH",
"I prefer Jayden Daniels. I just don't see Caleb as the generational talent he's made out to be. I do not see Mahomes at all.",
"Nobody is oerfect but I do believe in warning signs and I can compare the actual factual behavior patterns of the current Bears QB with the drama prone Williams camp. So far this is what we know, it has come from the Williams camp he may not want to play for the team with the top pick. It's also been questioned whether he is a beloved leader by his teammates. There is the painting of nails, there is the crying to Mommy thing. On the other hand, Fields is A+ on character and leadership, his teammates love him and a stadium filled of Chicago fans chanted to keep Fields. Personally,, I have seen enough from team Caleb to know I want them nowhere near my franchise. He will be a good player, more like a slightly better Kyler Murray, but I prefer steady and reliable. Give me Fields and a stacked roster.",

"Out of all that information from that ten minute video the one thing that really stood out for me was…..”his toenail painted foot onto an NFL field.” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂",
"😂😂",
"If the #1 pick isn’t going to be a top 10 player at his position, pass. Draft Harrison Jr. this year, but that ship already sailed. 🤦‍♂️",
"If Bears are smart, they'll be patient and sit him for a year. He'll get to learn at his own natural pace, mature as a man, and wont be subject to a ton of unnecessary hits in the process.    But its the Bears so we all know thats not gonna happen. Its a coinflip at best if he ever reaches his full potential in the nfl.",
"I believe he'll get thrown into the fray. I agree that it would be nice to sit him and develop him. At least the Bears have but together a pro bowl caliber offense for him which gives a great chance to do well. I'm heartbroken about JF but let's see what CW can do.",
"Cool, cool, cool. Thanks Alex!!",
"Thanks Moises brother!!!",
"🐻👇",
"Anything can happen, obviously....but to not see this guy as a LIKELY bust from a mile away is pretty amazing. Unless he matures LIKE CRAZY, I predict a 1% chance that his career is more Mahomes than Manziel.",
"there has to be some prejudice to this take cause there is 0 reason to view him as a likely bust",
"He’s got no fundamentals.  All arm. No footwork. 84 career fumbles. Lots of interceptions.  He should not be any teams starting QB.   He does not like the bears, so hopefully he will end up somewhere else.",
"⁠@@specialist-in-tech”he throws a lot of interception” bro has thrown 14 int’s in three seasons/ to 93 touchdowns thrown. “does not like the bears” no evidence of him saying that, why are you so miserable you just like to spread misinformation? Unless you are just very gullible and believe everything you see ?",
"Two things that I believe are working against CW; height and maturity.  People compare him to PM, but PM works his tail off to be that good.  CW's attitude is more like Kyler Murray, who needs a required film study time clause in his contract (Cardinals shouldn't have removed it).",
"It always comes down to the if. Preparation processing performance.",
"I'm sick of the excuses being made for JF not having a line, or his coaches suck, or whatever. What's any of that have to do with not being able to read the field and hitting the open guy when he DOES have time? Caleb is a MUCH better prospect in terms of actually playing the QB position. Everything JF got was mainly off of busted plays, or planned runs. He cost his line two-thirds of the sacks he had at least! Great dude? Yeah! Great at quarterback? No!",
"You’re a bit too obsessed with JF, I think you’re hurting your mental health",
"@@LiveLXStudios Probably right.",
"Has all day with SC O-line, looks pretty good. He won't have this time in the NFL, not on a bad team picking high. Also runs into trouble many times instead of running out of trouble. Strong arm is nice. Height isn't ideal, seems super money motivated, will likely disappoint at first, if not beyond first few years as pro. Bears kind of dumb, will get less out of Williams than Fields who hasn't had shit for a line in Chicago and has a $1.6 mil salary with $3.3 mil cap hit...f'n chiraq.",
"Or, at 4:20 does Caleb see number 9 and wait till he can’t block or intercept his pass.",
"I think that he plays more like Josh Allen then Mahomes tbh, not that it’s a bad thing, but he seems more similar to Josh than Mahomes",
"In game adjustments is what most successful QB naturally gifted with something draft analysts believe you can teach those stuffs. 4th quarter is where system QB separates from franchise QB. Please don’t mix with garbage time QB aka Carrbage",
"it's gonna be all about coaching and development with Caleb to harness his talent.   Everything is there, he shows everything you want to see just a matter of reps and coaching.",
"Caleb deep ball is elite tho. To hit at the rate he was hitting at is well above guys like Andrew luck, Trevor Lawrence, Justin Herbert, and tua when they were in college.",
"Bust painted on fingernails",
"If the team that drafts this dude is competent and has an actual plan for this dude then he will be phenomenal. That doesn’t mean that will be the case if they aren’t competent and don’t have a plan though. He could be ruined like many other QB’s in the past.",
"Bears should take Drake Maye but they won’t out of fear.",
"Caleb Williams is overrated",
"Bo nix and Daniels are by far the best in the draft sorry not sorrry",
"Stop with the BS hyping, the kid is a jerk",

"Bro he will not have a top 5 arm in the league. 1- josh allen  2- patrick mahomes  3- matthew stafford  4- aaron rodgers  5- justin herbert  6- jordan love 7- baker mayfield   Maybe number 8 but anthony richardson has a gun also. And there might be a few im missing but i dont think he has a stronger arm then any of the ones i listed",
"@AlexRollinsNFL where do you get this film from?",
"Alex says anything for clicks lmao. Dude said Herbert was gonna be a bust. Certified Hater.",
"His only negative is that he has the Josh Allen Hero Ball gene. A good coach will allow him to learn and just take an L on a play instead of chucking needless picks or hits. He is literally one of the best prospects we've ever seen.",
"NO",
"And also he couldn’t beat UTAH",
"QB that holds onto the ball too long and… NOT AGAIN.",
"i'm scared. he has issues (like every prospect) and the bears aren't exactly known for coaching up QBs",
"PLEASE do a Jaden Daniels video thanks",
"Also too add to DM, he needs to learn an NFL style offense.",
"There all different players of course but if i had to describe comparisons for the top 3:  CW: Josh Allen; some of the most amazing athletic  plays you will ever see in your life; super hero stuff.  Will struggle at times with the structured stuff. Good enough at seeing the field and processing but not elite; can struggle in a key game when elite defenses game plan them out of their strengths and comforts.  JD: Lamar Jackson/Jalen hurts type player. Passable processing, elite threat in the running game. Steadily developing  passing game. Very effective in offenses tailored around their strengths.   DM: Mix between JH/Maholmes. Has great tools; athleticism, arm, improv ability, at times accuracy. By far the best processor of the 3 and highest potential to become a top 3-5 qb in the league if he reaches his ceiling. Needs to work on his mechanics to improve his release and have more consistent accuracy. He demonstrates the ability to throw with anticipation. He’s not a complete product by any means but neither were Herbert or Maholmes when they came into the league. But he’s ahead of the curve at the moment.",
"This dude will make bears fans happy to lose again",
"Caleb will be a bust! It's so obvious! This is Trey Lance 2.0",
"caleb might be fruity but fields is garbage",
"Great video.",
"Dak with more mobility.",
"Great video, thx. If you were the GM for the Bears which QB are YOU taking? I'd take Daniles, myself.",
"I love how people who do CW breakdowns focus on the ND game 90% of the time.",
"Well their defense is good, we can watch him tear up mediocre defenses but what would that achieve when the NFL game is faster and more punishing than even the ND game. Notice he didn't tear Williams apart, he pointed out the good and bad. Media tends to just suck him off or hate him.",
"jayden daniels against the blitz 17 tds 0 int.",
"This guy is really bothered by the fingernails 😂  Great video though, amazing production made it easy to understand",
"Didn’t realize his footwork was this bad. Also some of this reeks of not being able to read the defense.",
"at 2:52 #16 was wide open but Williams struggles to play within structure and throw with anticipation. He doesn't let it fly. #16 had his man beat, and the other DB had his back turned to the receiver. Williams is staring right at #16 and doesn't rip it. It's one of many examples of him missing open targets that he will have to hit in the NFL. Also, he has a big arm, but not a strong arm. He's not strong enough to put the velocity that's required to fit the ball into tight windows, hence why he passed up the wide open man at 2:52. He is going to need Mahomes level work on him and starting him year one will be detrimental to his development. He isn't nearly as good of a prospect as Stroud was last year.",
"Cj Stroud is that generational prospect they were talking about",
"Yeah don’t overthink it. No one is perfext",
"I bet he doesn't want to do medical because his piss is hot . Or Jess hurt. .#CALEBLEAF",
"Bro no one cares about weed. He doesn’t do medical because he’s already going #1",
"FUCK THAT HES A RYAN LEAF !!!!",
"I do not think he will translate to the NFL as a rook.",
"You’re the same guy that said Justin Herbert would bust right?😂😂😂",
"DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE!!! Every year we say these kids are the future...top draft picks are NOT guaranteed",
"A college qb struggled a little with the worst defense in college? Does no one remember the clip of fields missing 3 open receivers and and sprinting into a lineman’s back? I love the kid, but seriously we have to try and draft the GREATEST prospect* in history",

"It's coming! After the draft though since it's draft season",
"@@AlexRollinsNFL good stuff",
"@@AlexRollinsNFL do a video on how tom clements developed aaron rodgers and jordan love",
"The Fields Williams debate was one of the dumbest all time. A guy struggling to prove he is a starter vs a unanimous number 1 pick😂. The actual nfl guys never took it seriously",
"Anybody else look at Caleb Williams and get flashbacks to the Fields conversation back in 2020? All of the tools are very similar and it's crazy that a direct comparison is not made more often",
"Great spotlight. Excited to see what he can do at the NFL level. Bears have cap space, and the first two picks in the draft with Caleb being a great prospect. If they can't turn it around in this situation, then they just might be cursed.",
"Thanks TLD!",
"Sounds like a Mini Justin Fields",
"So he needs to sit on 1 year. His talent needs to be polished, no doubt. Reading defenses, patience in the pocket, throwing accurately, they all can be improved. Can he improves it in Bears, though?",
"Williams is a QB Bears fans!  Not the villain which so many of you feel he is!",
"Great vid man, nice work! Sub’d",
"Thanks!",
"i mean a lot of qbs have succeeded despite trash footwork. Mahomes was very raw at texas tech, so was dak, etc.",
"mahomes had andy reid to develop him",
"Great content Alex! Nailed it as far as he can do it but can he be consistent. The only thing I can't understand is why people keep talking about interceptions being a concern. The guy threw 14int in 1024att in 3years. That is just over 1%. I was impressed with his numbers against the blitz. I have seen a few breakdowns that question him in this area.",
"He'll be good for a season, or one and a half seasons Then the DCs will start attacking his weaknesses and we'll see if hes going to turn to Mac Jones",
"Maybe the throwing mechanics need to be reworked like Josh Allen's.",
"rookie aarons rodgers",
"I love how much slower your cadence is when reciting. Listening to during your earlier videos was an extreme sport coz of how quickly you'd rattle out words which made me watch the video 2-4 times to understand what you were saying but now by the time I'm watching a vid for the fourth time, I've mastered it.",
"Thanks brother!!",
"I prefer Jayden Daniels. I just don't see Caleb as the generational talent he's made out to be. I do not see Mahomes at all.",
"Always happy to see ND film on here :)",
"I’ll never understand how many dudes think that it makes them more of a man to refuse to something because it’s “not manly” or whatever.  Pretty sure Caleb doesn’t mind if a bunch of dudes who are older than him make fun of him and his nails, or him crying on the sideline (which is something that happens in a lot of championship games across sports, btw). He’s already made more money than most will ever make through his own talent and hard work, I’m sure he could pull just about any girl he wanted, and he’s about to go first overall in the NFL draft.  My Redskins will probably end up with Maye, which I’ll be happy with—but I’d be happier than Caleb in Sephora if he ended up coming back to his hometown to sling scary Terry the rock.",
"Historically QBs who are top talent that sit instead of starting fare better. He’s either boom or bust since chances are he’s going to be thrust into starting wherever he’s going.",
"He also cries in his mommys arms 😂😂😂",
"At least, he has a mother who cares lol",
"Man you will shit your pants if you want to play like him, he is tough as hell and afraid of the contact, just watch him play kiddo",
"@@leongarcia382 shut the fukk up lil boy. I seen with my own eyes this guy crying in his mommys arms. Painting his nails like a woman. No way hell be leading an nfl team anywhere but another top 5 pick the next year l",
"He's the best college prospect I've ever seen since Andrew Luck, if not ever. He has Mahomes level arm talent, pocket presence, and is shiftier.  Caleb gets to the bottom of his drop without clicking his feet and keeps a wide base throughout the play, letting him be ready to throw the ball at any point. Andrew Luck is the best QB I've ever seen at climbing the pocket and the way Caleb does it is reminiscent of it.",
"Great material but to be precise, his base problem when dropping back isn't dropping back itself, this does not affect base. It is the fact that his backfoot is not underneath his right shoulder when he winds up for the throw. That means, he does not have a way to shift his weight from back to front when throwing, because his weight is already on the front. That takes away throwing power from the hip completely and leaves him with the body and arm throw, which hurts like hell, doesn't support longevity of the shoulder and is overall less accurate.",
"Fortunately its coachable and can very easily be fixed",
"Ya the bears have proven they coach bad habits outta quarterbacks pretty well",
"Kaleb comes across to me as Dak Prescott 2.0 at best",
"We will take that lol",
"It’s weird I watched Caleb a lot this year he reminds more of rookie year Mahomes he is always looking to extend the play and his pocket awareness is great but sometimes he’ll make his tackles job harder. Nothing coaching can’t fix if he’s a learner. Great video Alex.",
"You mention that his arm strength will be top-5 in the league, but that when off his base his arm strength suffers. Does he still have elite arm strength when off-platform a la Mahomes/Rodgers/Allen, or more of a strong arm like PFM/Drew Brees/Brady where part/most of the power comes from the feet/hips? Not disagreeing that he does obviously have arm strength, just curious what type of guy you think he is.   I hear a lot about Caleb's game being similar to Mahomes', but watching these examples he doesn't seem to have that extra godly-ness to his throws that Mahomes/Rodgers have. To me he seems a lot closer Russell Wilson.",
"Watch some more tape. Those type of throws are there.",
"Nobody is oerfect but I do believe in warning signs and I can compare the actual factual behavior patterns of the current Bears QB with the drama prone Williams camp. So far this is what we know, it has come from the Williams camp he may not want to play for the team with the top pick. It's also been questioned whether he is a beloved leader by his teammates. There is the painting of nails, there is the crying to Mommy thing. On the other hand, Fields is A+ on character and leadership, his teammates love him and a stadium filled of Chicago fans chanted to keep Fields. Personally,, I have seen enough from team Caleb to know I want them nowhere near my franchise. He will be a good player, more like a slightly better Kyler Murray, but I prefer steady and reliable. Give me Fields and a stacked roster.",
"Its important to take into account that because of his awful defense caleb had to be the hero every game. No doubt that affected his game",
"do you trust the bears offensive staff to properly develop him",
"@@ektran4205  probably not",
"@@ektran4205 I like Waldron as a hire for the offense. What I'm not as sold on is Eberflus and developing a consistent top 10 defense. Jim Schwartz took a Browns defense group that was underachieving and made them a top 5 group. Hell even Brian Flores took a defensive roster that I'd argue is below average and gave them a high floor against opposing offenses/QBs who can't fully punish blitzes. Sure 'Flus got his edge player in Sweat but the trenches and DBs still need more talent.",
"@@ektran4205I trust the bears defense alot more ntm having DJ Moore and Keenan Allen",
"We were almost the top defense in the nfl after we got swear alone. We will be fine. Comments kinda ignorant ​@@t4d0W",
"I hope we see some analyzation videos on some WRs. Maybe Rome Odunze, Brenden Rice, Xavier Legette, Keon Coleman, Luke McCaffrey, etc",
"Caleb Williams is the future of the NFL but he's also not a slam dunk? What? So which one is it?",
"I think he got so much backlash from the Jordan Love stinks vid that he kinda had to play both sides and let it ride.",
"LOL I mean you can be both at this point. Any top QB is gonna play second fiddle to Mahomes for the next decade anyway. The real question is can that future QB be close to that level as #15  but still beat the Chiefs everywhere else and on defense?",
"Just because your team can't get him, you gotta dig deap and find flaws. Go Bears",
"We shall see. Who knows. That’s boring and doesn’t get views. It’s the truth tho.",
"His anticipation is strongly lacking.  I didn't get to see as much of this team as I would've liked during the season, so I appreciate your breakdown.  He's got solid physical skills, but he needs to get the ball out quicker, especially since the windows will be smaller, and close faster, at the League level.",
"Color me shocked! Not perfect?!??",
"As A Bears 🐻 Fan I Want To Keep Justin Fields BUT Us Die Hard Fans Are Gonna Cheer Just As Hard For Caleb When He Puts On A Bears Jersey! I’m Just Ready For The Bears To Make A Trade For The #1 Pick Or Justin NOW lol So I Can See What The Team Is Going To Look Like Lol! 💯",
"He has two futures   Being a QB somewhere with potential    Or being the bears pick, amd being a career backup in 5 years  Bears gotta be banned from drafting QBs because what they are doing to these young athletes",
"Trade down for mhj and roll with Justin and hard focus on getting lineman in the draft this year and work on the defense next season",
"He very clearly struggles to read defenses well. Post snap reads and throwing with anticipation definitely needs to be worked on. The arm talent is there though for sure but he’s far from generational imo.",
"let's be honest here. JJ McCarthy is the best QB in this year's draft",
"Hope he proves all the doubters and haters wrong",
"JJ McCarthy IS NOLAN-SINGLETARY ERA 49ERS alex smith",
"@@ektran4205 McCarthy has stronger arm than Alex Smith",
"I think there is no question of Williams superior QB attributes, but my question is this: Did any of his USC teammates even show up to his birthday party? He sort of reminds me of a much more talented Josh Rosen.",
"Caleb has some ugly tape no doubt, but his playmaking and hero complex are gonna play into that. If a team gets him to clean his footwork and take the check downs his abilities will really shine a la Mahomes.",
"Mr. Rollins, thank you for showing what Williams should improve on as a pro. As a bears fan, I rather our coaches fix a rookie's flaws than a 4 year qb's flaws that hasnt changed since college.",
"Well as a Bears fan as well I do not want to take a rookie who on his Scouting Report has the same issues y'all was just complaining about Justin having. This is what this video is showing right now. And I'm sorry I don't want to go through any more Growing Pains I rather take fields and let's get this ball rolling.   And that is what the bears going to do. So feel ready to be disappointed.",
"Bro fields is so cooked it’s over 💀 give it up",
"@hiyves9880  stfu you know nothing, please tell me why he is cooked and it's over who told you this. Yall on the internet are nothing but a bunch of dumb🍑es",
"The immature cry baby turns the ball over more then kirk cousins and Nathon Peterman combined. RIP",
"I agree with letting him sit for a year or at the very least half a year just to get more comfortable. The other thing that would help, having a good run game. We know having a solid run game helps every quarterback but for a rookie it can be particularly helpful just to give defenses something else to think about as they grow. The Bears not drafting him would be foolish because while he has some imperfections, just like every player drafted ever, you take a chance on a top notch talent who demonstrated for three years they are good. This isn't a Ryan Leaf or Jamarcus Russell who had one great year in college with a few solid seasons before, he was good to great all three years. Playing it safe rarely works in the NFL, you take great talent, build around him, coach him up and you can't worry about him being a bust because the NFL is littered with guys who were can't miss but missed along with guys with major concerns such as Justin Herbert, Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes, who teams hit big with. Take your chances with great talent to reach greatness and live with the results rather than playing it safe to get the same middling results.",
"In the case of Herbert, the Chargers hit pay dirt with him but Telesco could never build a defense that could help him protect leads or get him the ball back. Even worse when Staley is also inconsistent in calling game plans especially against the run. At least Mahomes will def admit his 2024 SB is in large part credit to Spags and that Chiefs defensive group that was just elite in the playoffs even against Allen and Lamar. Teams def won't admit when they didn't do their part to help out their super star QB and their fans in some cases will still think they actually have optimal talent around their super star QB.",
"Love the vid Alex, sent you an email btw.",
"Thanks brother! Which email did you send it to?",
"Justin Herbert is the next NFL draft BUST",
"look at justin's rookie season when he had pep hamilton",
